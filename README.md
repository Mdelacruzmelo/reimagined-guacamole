# reimagined-guacamole

Hi! This is a technical skill test.


## Installation
The project can be installed by placing in the root folder where the <span style="color: green">package.json</span> file is. Execute the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
We can run the project in 3 different ways. For development mode, execute:
```bash
# within /reimagined-guacamole
npm start
```
Command for compiling

npm run build

## Additional

### <span style="color: green"><span style="font-weight: bold">PLP</span> -  Product List Page</span>
Page where the list of products will be displayed.\
When selecting a product, you will need to navigate to the product details.

### <span style="color: green"><span style="font-weight: bold">PDP</span> - Product Details Page</span>
This page will be divided into two columns:
- Check a detailed image of the product on the left hand side
- In the second column, the details and actions of the product will be displayed

- I just covered one single test at least to use the command "npm run test" 
- I could have used redux sagas or redux toolkit, but as there was a plan to save the data in localStorage, then redux was not necessary.

Every feedback is welcome!
